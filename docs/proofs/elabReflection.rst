Extending Idris using Elaborator Reflection
===========================================

Idris provides a mechanism to modify the language without having to recompile Idris itself. We can think of this in terms of metaprogramming or domain specific languages or just building in new capabilities.

In order to extend the language we need to know something about how Idris is complied. On this page we try to limit this explanation to only what we need to customise the elaboration. For more details of the compiler see `Edwin Brady 2013 paper`_ and for customising the elaboration process see `David Christiansen Practical Reflection and Metaprogramming`_ and  `Elaborator reflection: extending Idris in Idris`_. For more information about holes and guesses see `Dependently Typed Functional Programs and their Proofs McBride 1999`_.

Here is a diagram of the multistage process at the top level when Idris code gets compiled:

TT is a core language which is syntactically very simple, this makes it easy for computers to process but very verbose and hard for humans to read. This elaboration is done by a logic language (proof tactics) similar to LTac in Coq. Here we use the word 'tactics' to refer to these elaboration tactics - not to be confused with the old tactics mechanism.

This gives the opportunity to allow the primitives of the elaboration mechanism  to be exposed to metaprograms.
During elaboration TT (Raw) structure contains:

- holes - terms yet to be inferred.
- guesses - Suppresses Î²-reduction while precise structure not known.

Type checker:

- include universe levels
- distinguish between global and local bound names.

As already mentioned the TT core language is kept syntactically very simple. Part of the reason for this is that its correctness is already well proven using logic. For instance, here are the binders in TT with corresponding code and logic type introduction rules:

   * - There is an elaborator for both definitions and terms, the definition elaborator calls the term elaborator when required.
